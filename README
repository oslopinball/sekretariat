# What's all this then?

This is a repository for the different tools that are used by the current Oslo
Pinball Club secretariat to automate some tasks. Currently this includes:

* Sending out welcome emails to new people joining the club.
* Sending out emails about paying for the yearly dues (Ã¥rskontingent).

Probably best that each tool has it's own sub-directory, but that's up to you.
